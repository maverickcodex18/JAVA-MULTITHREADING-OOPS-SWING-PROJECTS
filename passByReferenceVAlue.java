     * In Java, all arguments to methods are passed by value, which means that a copy of the value (either a primitive or a reference) is passed to the method. Java does not support true pass-by-reference as found in some other programming languages like C++. However, it's essential to understand how references work in Java to avoid common misconceptions.

In Java:

For primitive data types (e.g., int, double, boolean), the method receives a copy of the actual value.
For objects, what gets passed is a copy of the reference to the object, not the object itself. This can sometimes give the appearance of pass-by-reference behavior.

arrays are passed by value if is of primitive data type
if arrays are of UDT , then they are pazsed by reference.
